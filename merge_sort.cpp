/*Instructions
a) Sort a given set of N integer elements using Merge Sort technique and compute its time taken. Run the program for different values of N and record the time taken to sort.
b) There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n)).
a) Sort a given set of N integer elements using Quick Sort technique and compute its time taken
b) Given an integer N which is a multiple of 4, the task is to find an N x N grid for which the bitwise xor of every row and column is same.*/
